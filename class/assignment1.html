     <p>Alan Mathison Turing (1912â€“1954) was an English mathematician, logician, and cryptographer. Often considered the father of computer science, Turing proposed the concept of a universal machine, now known as the Turing machine, which laid the foundation for the modern theory of computation. During World War II, he played a pivotal role in deciphering the Enigma code, significantly contributing to the Allied victory. In 1950, he introduced the Turing Test as a way to measure a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. Tragically, Turing's life was cut short in 1954 under tragic circumstances, but his legacy continues to influence artificial intelligence and computing.</p>
